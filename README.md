# UAV-integration-with-soft-robotics-for-telesurgery-applications
This project explores a modular system combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with soft robotic manipulators to enable remote telesurgical tasks in emergency settings. It focuses on safe, precise intervention in confined or hazardous environments using teleoperation and adaptive actuation technologies.
